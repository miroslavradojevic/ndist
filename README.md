Java implementation of spatial distance measures between two neuron reconstructions. Calculates average spatial distance (SD), substantial spatial distance (SSD) and percentage of nodes with substantial spatial distance (%SSD) between two SWC neuron reconstruction files. Threaded implementation, works significantly faster than vaa3d's implementation, possible to batch process large number of reconstructions with image's macro language. Peng, Hanchuan, et al.
